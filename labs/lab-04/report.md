## Lab 4: Licensing

3. Choosing a license is important to ensure that a project can or cannot be used/shared in the way that you desire. To ensure that a project in open source, for instance, it is important to ensure that it has an OSI approved license applied to it.
4. Using a project without an explicit license can be dangerous, as you cannot be sure what exactly you are allowed to do with it. Modifying or redistributing a project without a clear license allowing you to do so could land you in legal trouble.
5. Yes, I believe this claim to be accurate. By failing to release the software to the public early, it failed to build the kind of community that it would require to support its lifetime. A community both in developers and users.
6. Linux uses the [GPL v2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License#Version_2) license because GPL was written by Richard Stallman specifically for use with programs released as part of the GNU project. Many of the system software and libraries supporting [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) are provided by the GNU project, so the two are very heavily linked and it makes sense that they would utilize the same license. As for GPL's creation for GNU, [Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman) has a history of being a major pioneer and advocate for free software, which he wanted to apply to the GNU project as well.
